# Supervised machine learning loan default classification model. Utilized exploratory data analysis and visualizations to look for trends between loan groups.   Utilized the following machine learning models for classification: Keras Deep Learning, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, SVM, Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier and knn.  Accuracy and cross-validation score testing, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC/ROC tested on all models.
